The core idea is to build a community of game makers, developers, and artists in the Delaware area.

It would be really amazing if we could become something of a hub for people interested in making games in this geographical area, and be the place where people can meet each other and work on things that are better together than they are alone!

Long term we could host game jams and other outreach/community events, and overall facilitate collaboration between people with different skillsets to work on their games.

Most of our online community activity is going to be through the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/HxBjaQ), so come say hi!
